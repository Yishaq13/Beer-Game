You are now in charge of creating a system that would efficiently produce and sell Beer, with the ultimate goal of making sure everyone on the planet (or the galaxy) has enough beers forever.

\doxysection*{Getting Started}

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

\doxysubsection*{Prerequisites}

What things you need to install the software and how to install them


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{GNU C++: https://gcc.gnu.org/install/}
\DoxyCodeLine{Qt: https://www.qt.io/download}
\DoxyCodeLine{CMake: https://cmake.org/install}
\DoxyCodeLine{Doxygen: https://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygen/}
\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysubsection*{Installing}

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Place the follwoing step into terminal to build the project.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build \&\& cd build \&\& cmake ..}
\end{DoxyCode}


You can now make the project


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\end{DoxyCode}


To execute the project you need to run 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./src/beergame}
\end{DoxyCode}


to execute the testing


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./test/beergame-\/test}
\end{DoxyCode}


and to make docs run


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make doc}
\end{DoxyCode}


and then the documentation can be found in the directory {\ttfamily doc} and in the directory {\ttfamily doc}. \doxysection*{Built With}
